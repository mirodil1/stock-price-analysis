# Stock Price Analysis

In this project , I used pandas to perform various financial analyses of stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance.  

Specifically, in this project, I did the following tasks:
- Fetching and organizing stock data from Yahoo Finanace
- Plotting time-series prices
- Plotting volume-series data
- Calculating simple daily percentage change
- Calculating simple daily cumulative returns
- Resampling data from daily to monthly return
- Analyzing distribution of returns
- Performing moving-average calculations
- Comparing average daily returns across stocks
- Correlating stocks based on the daily percentage change of closing prices
- Calculating stock volatility
- Visualizing risk relative to expected returns

I made this project with help of book ***Learning pandas***
